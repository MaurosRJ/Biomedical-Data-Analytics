# Stroke Prediction Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting stroke risk among adults in the US and Canada to support public health initiatives aimed at reducing stroke incidence by 10%. The analysis emphasizes improving patient education and deploying advanced glucose and BMI monitoring systems in healthcare clinics, with a particular focus on increasing accessibility in underrepresented regions.

## Objectives
- Develop a predictive model for stroke risk based on key health metrics (e.g., glucose levels, BMI, age, and other demographic factors).
- Enhance patient education through data insights to promote preventive care.
- Identify underrepresented regions with higher stroke risk for targeted health interventions.
- Support healthcare decision-making through data-driven approaches.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Add data source name, e.g., public health databases, clinical datasets, or synthetic data].
- **Size**: [Include dataset size if known, e.g., number of rows/columns].
- **Key Features**:
  - Patient demographics (e.g., age, gender, region).
  - Health metrics (e.g., glucose levels, BMI, blood pressure).
  - Lifestyle factors (e.g., smoking status, physical activity).
  - Stroke incidence (binary target variable: Yes/No).

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values and outliers to ensure data integrity.
   - Normalized and scaled health metrics for consistent analysis.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Identified correlations between health metrics and stroke risk.
   - Visualized trends and regional disparities using tools like Tableau and Matplotlib.
   
3. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Trained machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict stroke risk.
   - Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   
4. **Targeted Insights**:
   - Pinpointed high-risk regions and demographic groups for focused interventions.
   - Designed health education strategies based on model predictions.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Languages**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotl
